							<h1>Gaming in Nepal</font></h1><br><br>
							<p align="justify">Gaming in Nepal is growing at a faster pace than ever before, providing lots of carrier
opportunity to great players. But, it&apos;s clear that we Nepali people have been very
vicious towards gaming in Nepal. We have always taken gaming as only a source of
entertainment and to a certain amount it is, but we should also see the large growing
industry of eSports (electronic sports) as it is taking the world&apos;s economic market by a
huge blow. We are still backwards in the eSports scene because of lack of resources
like fast Internet and powerful gaming machines but most importantly lack of support
from parents in this sector. It&apos;s not wrong for the parents to be concerned about it if
their children want to make a carrier in gaming or eSports as the scene is not well
established yet in the country. But if we don&apos;t support a sector when it&apos;s in developing
state can we just attach to it later?</p>

<p align="justify">The global video gaming business is growing enormously as the size of the market has
been increasing substantially every year. The size of the market was USD 93.1 billion
in 2015, which grew to USD 106.5 billion in 2016 and USD 121.7 billion in 2017. The
projection for 2018 is USD 137.9 billion which is expected to reach a whopping USD
180.1 billion in 2021. Each successful game attributes to the growth of this ever
increasing market. In recent years Fortnite the world&apos;s most popular game with over
150 million players worldwide had decided to organize a world cup gathering the best
players from across all regions. They announced that they were going to giveaway 100
million dollars in just tournament prize alone. Large tournament prize pools started as
Valve decided to organize a USD 1 million tournament for the game DOTA 2 (Defense
of the Ancients) back in 2011. That alone brought talents from across the globe to
compete in the tournament. As people started investing in eSports teams slowly
eSports grew as an emerging carrier for talented youths.</p>

<p align="justify">Coming back to the country, we started out in cyber cafes playing games like DOTA,
Counter Strike 1.6 or many other Single Player/Multiplayer games. The eSports trend
flew in and small scale /local tournaments started in Nepal as well. Teams formed and
slowly prize pools also went up in those tournaments and so did the craze. New
gaming stations are being opened across the town bringing in talented gamers
together.</p>

<p align="justify">In recent days PUBGM (Player Unknown&apos;s Battlegrounds: Mobile) has been emerging
in popularity as it is widely available to play even in low end mobile phones. Other
popular games that are emerging in popularity other than the classic eSports game
like Counter Strike and DOTA are Battle Royale games like Fortnite, PUBG, and Apex
Legends. They are yet to be well established in the scene but are growing in popularity
through social media like Twitch.tv/YouTube gaming/Mixer. Content creation and

game live streaming is being a huge part of the gaming industry as well. In fact most of
them are more popular than the classic eSports players. Streaming has been so
popular and made easy by cheap internet and mid end machines also being able to
handle streaming and gaming. This has led to streaming being more competitive in the
recent years.</p>

<p align="justify">Gaming companies have started to recognize the potential that the Nepali gaming
scene has. WASD arena has been helping the scene in various ways like organizing
tournaments and also streaming the games/tournaments, helping with servers in
tournaments as well as online servers for players to practice together in. They have
also recently opened an online store with gaming products for Nepali gamers in cheap
price. I personally have bought gears from their shop and am a happy customer. The
Warriors Esports (TW Esports) have been organizing online tournament in Faceit and
are working together with WASD arena for organizing better tournaments here in
Nepal. myRevenge e.V. a gaming company from Germany has recently taken up
Counter Strike and DOTA teams from Nepal. Online tournaments like ESL India are
also being played by many teams. Some have qualified for LAN events of ESL India
Premiership.</p>

<p align="justify">On the other hand we have games with online tournaments like Fortnite and PUBG.
Fortnite tournaments and scrims are really popular. Hamro Nepali Gaming had been
organizing tournaments in Fortnite.PUBG M tournaments have also started to rise in
popularity.</p>

<p align="justify">Only cyber cafes and small organizations used to organize eSports tournaments but in
the past two years we have seen changes with big tournaments and popularity in
YouTube gaming and streaming. Gaming Station like PP (Power-Play, Bhotahiti) which
has the best players, who are helpful and always welcome new gamers happily.
There are a lot others that we can name. But they are all bringing in the players
together and help each other grow their gaming skills.</p>

<p align="justify">&quot;Current state of Professional gaming is less about gaming and more about business
growth. Unless government gives some attention to gaming field it&apos;s hard for gaming
to gain bright future in Nepal. And yeah if Nepali gamers get some attention those
people can obviously prove in International Platforms too&quot; Says Nirmal &apos;Kamui San&apos;
Tamang, a Fortnite Player and YouTube streamer.</p>

<p align="justify">As a gamer myself I can relate to a lot of problems going on in the country regarding
gaming. Also, recent ban of PUBG-M by government of Nepal brings threat to the
eSports scene too.</p>

<p align="justify">We shall not just watch the negative side of it. Let&apos;s all of us stand together to let
people realize the positive side of gaming. If we can be a step towards the success of
eSports in the country then, why not?</p>
<p align="justify">Let&apos;s give it a shot. The gaming scene which is like a Fiction right now, let&apos;s all change
it into a reality. Join us today!</p>

							<h3 align="left">Country in Fire as Government decides to ban PUBG M</h3>
						<font color="white">	<p align="justify">All of a sudden The Kantipur Daily releases a news article &quot;Popular online
multiplayer game PUBG is banned in Nepal.&quot; Government has already sent out
notice to all the Internet service providers. Slowly the ban will be effective in a
few days. This incident has made the youth raging on social media and cussing the
government. Let&apos;s dive a little deeper in this topic and evaluate the situation.</p>

<p align="justify">First let&apos;s discuss the things that have led us into this situation. It&apos;s obviously our
parents who have filed the case against the game. This shows the generation gap
that we have. I have seen videos of parents dancing after the ban. In their view
they have done the right and are happy about the situation.</p>

<p align="justify">Alright the game is now banned, but is that really the solution? For the long term
it&apos;s not.</p>
<p align="justify">Let me just put all of our views into this. The parents are also the ones responsible
for what is going on. Too much of anything is bad. Gaming is not bad but
unmanaged and unbalanced lifestyle caused by gaming is bad. Parents can ban a
game but can&apos;t control the amount of hours their child plays a game? That’s
irony.</p>

<p align="justify">Random Nepali a YouTuber from Nepal brought up a really good point in his
recent video about the PUBG ban. He said &quot;Solution is not to ban the game but to
manage the cause of its negative side.&quot; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vStOqOMZATY" target="_blank">Click here</a> to watch Random Nepali&apos;s video.</p>


<p align="justify">Should we not think about the people
who were making a carrier out of the game; The YouTubers and Streamers? Are
we all so childish that if we can&apos;t do a thing we just destroy it? Gaming progresses in other countries and we? We just go back and back with
every wrong step we take. Should we question the government for protest?
Didn&apos;t we try that during other problems as well? I&apos;m definitely not saying that we
shouldn&apos;t protest against it. But we know our government will hold us back or just
stop like they do during a VIP &quot;Sawari&quot; I feel bad saying I am a citizen of a
democratic country where if a single person does wrong then the right of all the
other people is just snatched.</p>

<p align="justify">PUBG ban just threatens any other new games or any kind of entertainment sites
to enter the country, killing the dreams of hundreds and thousands. The passion
of people who really loved it will be lost forever. There might be alternatives but
they aren&apos;t as effective. Seeing only the negative side is not the way to go. Have

we ever seen the positives? Bringing in people together, creating carrier
opportunities for many people in the eSports sector.</p>

<p align="justify">On the other hand, we might have been wrong in the sense that we were
addicted to the game. That is certainly a bad sign and can have negative impacts
on our mental as well and physical health. Isn&apos;t that why the game is banned? If
people can balance life and gaming then we probably would not have been in this
spot. There is a lesson to be learnt here though. We should also try to convince
our parents and help them understand more about the eSports side and gaming
in general. It&apos;s new to them so it&apos;s wrong to them. We have a part in it too. They
will certainly understand us if we are able to convince them after all they are our
parents.</p>

<p align="justify">Let&apos;s all of us do what we can to revert the ban. Let&apos;s protest in Social Medias and
try to get to the government. Random Nepali also said in his video that if he has
enough supporters he will file a case back against the ban. Go and show some
support to a brother who is trying to help us out. Hope we can get the game back
and learn from our mistakes.</p>
