							<font type="Arial"><p align="justify">Started gaming early in my life. I got a PC when I was 8. GTA Vice-City was my first ever game. I&apos;ve played countless games of different genre. But the game that hooked me was Counter-Strike. I knew it was for me. Founded the team with the name Intense GamerZ alongside Pernicious and Laugh_CF. Slowly came to know about the competitive side of gaming. Even though our country had a small e-sports scene. We loved the competition. Went through a lot of ups and down with team and its members but have been stuck around with the team.
Love the gaming community who despite all hardships always used to game. That gives me the drive to move ahead and change the mindset people have about gaming in our region.
&quot;You think Gaming is fun? It is. But ever dove into the competitive community?&quot;</p></font>

							<p align="justify">It&apos;s me Anurag Maharjan, but around internet I go by the name Magica. Video games has always been a part of my life. I still remember the days when I used to go the the local gaming zones around my area and play different games. But I stopped going to gaming zones after my father gifted me my first ever PC on my birthday. I used to play different games like GTA San andreas,Vice City, miniclip games and so on. Then I started playing CS1.6 online. I hear people saying &quot;Gaming has always been a great way to know people.&quot; And well I guess it&apos;s true. I met avhy and laugh through CS1.6. I&apos;ve played different games but when I started playing Fortnite I really felt that Fortnite was the game for me. I played the game for hours and hours and kept learning more things and improving day by day. Today I am really happy to be a part of FictioN and feel really proud to play Fortnite for FictioN Gaming. I want to thank avhy a lot for recruiting me in FictioN. I always had a dream of playing game for a great team and today I&apos;m here with FictioN.</p>

He gave me a phone to play games and I played a lot of games like temple run and subway surfer that whole day. I got into PS4 games with my cousins PS4. And when I got mine I also really got hooked to different games and then I found out about Fortnite and have been playing since season one.</p>

							<p align="justify">I started gaming from my childhood when first screen-touch mobiles released. I used to play lots of GTA games in my desktop PC. When I heard about Fortnite I was totally into it. I was eagerly waiting for Fortnite to release on mobile. When Fortnite came out on end of season 3 I started playing it at first I had no idea I would ever be a good player but I started doing good and I got my first win while playing solo back in season 3. At first me and my friends had heard about Fortnite clan and we made one named. IGG (International Gaming Garage) but it didn&apos;t flourished. So we tried to join some other clans. The first clan I ever joined was EGN which was a great thing for me then I heard about many clans like TGX, FictioN, Zenesis, OuterR. I joined TGX_Babags clan. Stayed in that clan for a lot and now I have joined FictioN recently as a mobile player. This is a dream come true for me. Gaming is my passion but there are studies too, my parents support me on gaming and have promised me to but stuffs for it. And after I complete all my studies I have a dream to be a famous gamer who will be known all over the world I will promise not to leave FictioN and will always try to make my clans name on the top. This is the past and my passion on gaming.

Long story short I played Cs 1.6, loved it, earthquake made me pause gaming for 4 years, got a PC bought r6 dedicated 2 years to it instead of school and now I am here. Some useless stuff bout me: I am 13, gonna be fourteen in 14th of Aswin, stay inside my room 20/7, only have had 1 crush so far, have the Razer flagship v2 (I am trying my best to flex and am currently failing) and I plan on being better than shroud.

Later I was introduced to CS 1.6 by avhy, who is currently Fiction Leader. I didnot have internet back then and had to play offline with bots at home and used to play LAN with friends after school at gaming cafe. I started loving the game so much and the game became passion. Later we came to know about the competitive scene of gaming and the passion of all the friends lead us to forming a team named Intense GamerZ(IGZ), which later turned out to be Fiction Gaming. Then after switching to CSGO, when the CSGO competitive scene was just starting in Nepal, we started playing local tournaments, gone through many ups and down. And currently not involved in any games, but managing the team.

							<p align="justify">Well there were some games that i liked and used to play sometimes. But I downloaded Fortnite just because it was free on PlayStation store. I didn't even know what the game was about but as the days passed by i got to learn many things and got many friends through the game. Khulut was the man who recruited me into FictioN. Gaming is just not about having fun or time pass i think gaming is also a kind of passion. Living in a country like Nepal we can't think it as competitive as other countries. Seeing the gaming sector of Nepal I think it's changing and people are kind of adapting into this type of environment. So yeah going along the waves!
