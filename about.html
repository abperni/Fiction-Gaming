							<h3>Welcome to the Fictious World.</h3>
							<p align="justify" >We at FictioN Gaming (FG) are a family working together to grow the gaming industry from the Himalayas. Established in 2014 from a small group of friends playing Counter-Strike to a dedicated team in Counter-Strike:Global Offensive (CS:GO) playing tournaments we stuck around , went through ups and downs and finally now we are a family filled with talents in games like Fortnite and with Content Creators , Designers & Writers. We are looking into growing our skills and help progress the e-sports scene in the South Asian Region and beyond. Are you looking for some quality gaming content? Well you’re in luck as you’ll find quality clips from the players here. You’ll also find articles about hot topics in the e-sports scene and learn new and about gaming stuff in the article section. Be on the lookout for new gaming highlights every week. We are always looking to expand to more games.</p><br>
							<p align="justify">This website is a means to get to more people and let them know about the gaming scene in the South Asian Region to beyond. If you are already familiar to the gaming scene then you would love the Highlights section. But if you are not so known to the gaming scene you can always start from the Articles tab to learn more about Gaming and its current form in the regions. You can also be updated with the latest e-sports news in the article section. We are primarily a group of gamers working together for the betterment of the e-sports scene and the casual gaming scene. You should definitely check our YouTube channel to see more content from us.</p><br>
							<p align="justify">A little more background on how the team was started. Made by a group of friends in school, who used to play Counter Strike 1.6 at that time. We started with the name ‘Intense GamerZ’ (iGz). We slowly started to move into CS:GO and eventually started playing tournaments in the local scene here in Nepal. Changed members here and there also changed the team name to FictioN Gaming (FG) and played till the end of High school. Then we had to split off due to family pressures regarding gaming and focused more on our studies. Then after a gap for a year avhy who was playing Fortnite casually and had made some new friends online , decided to make a Fortnite Team with the same name “FictioN Gaming” Gradually we started playing scrims and moving together as a team. Made a full team of casual as well as a competitive team for the PC platform. Then slowly we expanded into the console scene hiring one of the best controller players in the scene. Everyone was passionate about joining the team and were helping to grow the team together with old members of the team. Slowly also expanding to the mobile scene and getting talented designers and content creators along the way. We are now a fully fledged team and now remembering the past hardships of gaming and people not being able to follow their passion on the gaming industry we decided to dive into the ocean of the growing internet world and make people realize that gaming is not just a way of entertainment and is also a passion of many people and a successful carrier in the industry.</p><br>
							<p>Let’s all acclimatize together to this emerging change in the entertainment industry and enjoy this beautiful spark of Gaming. </p><br>
